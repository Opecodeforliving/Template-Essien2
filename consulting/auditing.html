          <p>
            Many companies are finding it difficult to build or acquire – and then maintain – the depth and variety of technology skills necessary to assess the increasing flood of new information systems, regulatory requirements, new technologies and reengineered business processes. Others may have only infrequent needs for such skills, which makes the hiring of full-time staff impractical. And others, especially those who are expanding or moving into overseas markets, find it too expensive to have IT audit staff travel to review their systems in other parts of the country or the world.

            <p class="description">
                Under Section 404, a public / listed company must file an internal control report with the annual report asserting whether its internal control over financial reporting is effective, in both design and operation, in providing reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial reporting process. To achieve this outcome, you need a cost effective, top-down and risk-based approach to minimise non-value added activity and maximize the effectiveness of the resources you deploy.
                You   need   the   advice   of   someone   having   impeccable   "been   there,   done    that, improve that" credentials that is only available from having worked with other companies that had the same concerns and anxieties as you. Our methodology provides a process-based solution to help you get organized, set the foundation, document your processes and controls, and evaluate whether those processes and controls are achieving the intended results (design) and performing effectively (operation).
                Our thought leadership, methodologies and suite of technology solutions, combined with our competencies in processes, risks and controls will help you comply successfully.
